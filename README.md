## Introduction 
This project is a multi-page website made for a  store called Cell Planet and Gift Corner. The main goal is to create a simple, good-looking, and easy-to-use website where people can explore different mobile accessories like AirPods, screen guards, chargers, and phone covers. The entire website is built using just HTML and CSS. It focuses on clean design, proper layout, and a smooth browsing experience. Each page is carefully made to look consistent and make it easy for users to find what they’re looking for.

## Installation
Since this project is a basic website built with just HTML and CSS, there’s no need to install anything to make it work. You don’t need extra tools, programs, or libraries. It’s made to run directly in any web browser. All you have to do is open the website files (like home.html) on your computer, and the website will show up. This makes it easy to share and use because it works offline and doesn’t need any setup or installations.

## Libraries Used
This project does not require any extra libraries. The website is built using just HTML and CSS. These are the basic building blocks for creating web pages, and they help make the website look nice and work smoothly. Everything is built from scratch, so you don’t need to install any special tools or packages. All you need is a web browser to open and view the site.

## Project Structure
The website is made up of several pages, each with its own purpose. Here’s how everything is structured:

1. Home Page: This is the first page visitors will see. It introduces the store and gives a quick look at what the website offers.
2. Products Page: On this page, users can see all the different mobile accessories for sale. Items like AirPods, chargers, and phone cases are listed here for easy browsing.
3. Registration Page: If users want to create an account, they can do it here by providing basic details like their name, email, and phone number.
4. Contact Page: This page includes the store’s contact info and gives users a way to reach out if they have any questions or need support.
5. About Us Page: On this page, users can learn more about the store, its mission, and what it’s all about.
All the pages are designed to be simple and easy to use. Everything is structured clearly, so users can quickly find the information they need.
