## Introduction 
This project is a multi-page website made for a  store called Cell Planet and Gift Corner. The main goal is to create a simple, good-looking, and easy-to-use website where people can explore different mobile accessories like AirPods, screen guards, chargers, and phone covers. The entire website is built using just HTML and CSS. It focuses on clean design, proper layout, and a smooth browsing experience. Each page is carefully made to look consistent and make it easy for users to find what they’re looking for.

## Installation
Since this project is a basic website built with just HTML and CSS, there’s no need to install anything to make it work. You don’t need extra tools, programs, or libraries. It’s made to run directly in any web browser. All you have to do is open the website files (like home.html) on your computer, and the website will show up. This makes it easy to share and use because it works offline and doesn’t need any setup or installations.
